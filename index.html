                        When cars were invented, the idea of a “computer” controlling the steering and acceleration would have seemed maniacal; 
                        but, the world has come a long way since then, and luckily, so has the automotive industry. Software control systems in 
                        automobiles have become commonplace in recent decades, with many countries even requiring systems such as automatic braking, 
                        lane assist, or obstacle avoidance for safety purposes. As the efficacy and reliability of these systems increases, consumers 
                        expect these systems in their new vehicles to help with comfortable, convenient driving. Semi-autonomous (or even fully autonomous) 
                        driving can be safe and effective, allowing drivers to relax a little more while in situations such as highway traffic or long drives. 
                        However, it is not without its danger. Numerous instances of software control system errors, safety system errors, and other failures 
                        have led to accidents, sometimes causing injury or death. As such, it is critical for software control systems in vehicles to have safety 
                        as their number one priority, and to do so from the outset of their design. When software control systems are fully reliable, they can offer 
                        incredible benefits for drivers. Between improved safety, ease of driving, and automation of tiring tasks, there is a huge range of opportunities 
                        for companies to make their vehicles more appealing to customers. A common example of one of these systems is Adaptive Cruise Control, 
                        which functions as a regular cruise control while watching for vehicles ahead, slowing down to match the speed of any vehicles detected. 
                        Another is that of lane assist, or lane following, which adjusts the car’s steering to keep it centered in its lane. Systems like these let drivers 
                        stay relaxed and comfortable on the road while still staying safe, and are often at the forefront of current automotive development. 
                        Currently, fully autonomous driving is gaining a foothold in the automotive space, with more and more companies deploying these systems in their vehicles. 
                        As well, semi-autonomous safety and convenience features are constantly being developed and improved.

                        This project is a collaboration between the Software Engineering student team (TJA1) 
                        and W. Milam Consulting/Ford, aimed at designing a safe and effective Traffic Jam Assist (TJA)
                        system. The proposed TJA system will utilize steering support, adaptive cruise control, and other 
                        smart driving features intended to reduce the strain of traffic on drivers and improve overall 
                        safety in slow/stop-and-go traffic conditions. 
                        The primary goal of this project is to design and prototype a fully functional Traffic Jam 
                        Assist software system while applying core Software Engineering principles. The final product 
                        will include an interactive prototype supported by a thorough Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that meets industry-level safety and quality standards. 
                        Through the partnership with W. Milam Consulting, the team was offered insights from a 
                        real industry professional into the details automotive software development practices. The client 
                        provided safety, practical, and technical standards, as well as the overall experience of interacting 
                        with a customer and emulating the process of adjusting the system to meet expectations with the final product. In all, this project thoroughly demonstrated the process and considerations 
                        involved when developing safety-critical automotive systems.
